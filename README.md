A fun and interactive two-player Python game where players take turns to pick sticks. The player who picks the last stick loses!

## ðŸ§  Underlying Algorithm

This game uses a **Greedy Turn-Based Deduction Strategy**:

- Players make choices to reduce sticks on each turn by **1 or 2**.
- There is no AI; decisions are made by **human input**.
- The player forced to pick the **last stick loses**.

If an AI were implemented, the optimal strategy could be powered by the **Minimax Algorithm**, especially in a bot-vs-bot version.
